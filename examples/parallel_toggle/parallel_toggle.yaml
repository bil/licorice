# parallel_toggle
#
# A simple model that toggles parallel port pin 9 up and down every two seconds
# This model reads from the parallel port as well, but does not do anything with that value (just for demo purposes)
#
#
# Note: model configuration is still in alpha stage and subject to cosmetic changes
