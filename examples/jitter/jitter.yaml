# jitter_demo
#
# A model that simply runs the timer process with no child processes
# Timer outputs a 1-ms tick to the specified parallel port address
#
# Note: model configuration is still in alpha stage and subject to cosmetic changes
#

config:
  # change this address to your parallel port data out address
  # can locate this with: `cat /proc/ioports | grep parport` 
  parport_tick_addr: 0  # typical IO address for motherboard parallel ports
  tick_len: 1000
