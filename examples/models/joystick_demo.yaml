# USB Joystick demo
#
# A model that outputs values from a joystick axis and buttons
# This model requires the USB kernel to have been compiled
#
#
# Note: model configuration is still in alpha stage and subject to cosmetic changes
#

signals:

  joystick_axis:
    shape: 2
    dtype: double

  joystick_buttons:
    shape: 6 # set this to the number of buttons to extract from the joystick
    dtype: uint8

modules:

  joystick_out:
    language: python
    constructor: True # the constructor and parser perform all USB manipulation through pygame
    parser: True
    in:
      name: jdev
      args:
        type: usb_input # this is an arbitrary input type that supports inputs that are read at some interval
