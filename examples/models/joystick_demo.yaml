# USB Joystick demo
#
# A model that outputs values from a joystick axis
# This model requires the USB kernel to have been compiled
#
#
# Note: model configuration is still in alpha stage and subject to cosmetic changes
#

signals:

  joystick_axis:
    shape: 2
    dtype: double

  joystick_buttons:
    shape: 6 # set this to the number of buttons on the joystick
    dtype: uint8
