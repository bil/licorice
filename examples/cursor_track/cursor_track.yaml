# cursor Pygame demo
#
# A model that reads from a joystick axis and places the movement as a cursor on a pygame window
# This model requires the USB kernel to have been compiled
# This model also requires a working pygame visualization installation
#
#
# Note: model configuration is still in alpha stage and subject to cosmetic changes
