# Logger demo
#
# This model demonstates the SQLite logger features of LiCoRICE
# 
#
# Note: model configuration is still in alpha stage and subject to cosmetic changes
#

signals:

  scalar_out:
    shape: 1
    dtype: int8
    log: true
    # scalars are stored raw
    # this will receive the column name r_i1_scalar_out in the SQLite database

  vector_ints:
    shape: 3
    dtype: int16
    log: true
    log_storage:
      type: vector
    # by default, 1D vectors stored one element per column, this can be overwritten to a different type by the log_storage parameter
    # this signal will receive columns named v_i2_vector_ints_0, v_i2_vector_ints_1, and v_i2_vector_ints_2

  vector_floats:
    shape: 4
    dtype: double
    log: true
    log_storage:
      type: vector
      suffixes:
        - x
        - y
        - z
        - z2
    # 1D vectors of floats are also broken up into separate columns
    # the suffixes key permits labels to be added to these columns instead of automatically assigning an index
    # this signal will receive columns named v_f8_vector_floats_x, v_f8_vector_floats_y, ...

  matrix_out:
    shape: (2,2)
    dtype: double
    log: true
    # matrices are flattened, packed through msgpack, and stored as a blob in a single column
    # this signal will receive columns named m_f8_matrix_out
